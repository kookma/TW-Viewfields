# TW-Viewfields

The Toggle view tiddler fileds in brief `viewfields` plugin adds a button to page controls lets
toggle view (show/hide) tiddler fields at view mode!

The tiddler fields by default are hidden in view mode! This plugin lets simply edit those fileds while tiddler are rendered and seen in view mode.
